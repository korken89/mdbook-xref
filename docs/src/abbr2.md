# The `mdbook-abbr2` preprocessor

This preprocessor, in combination with the `mdbook-xref` preprocessor, provides simple abbreviation
support for your mdBook.

Abbreviations are defined in a CSV file (whose path is configured using the `preprocessor.abbr2.path` configuration key
in your `book.toml`) in the following format:

```
<Abbreviation>, <Description>[, <Optional hover text>]
# For example
CSV, Comma Separated Value
# And with custom hover text
CAB, Complicated Abbreviation with a very long description that's unsuitable for hover text, Complicated Abbreviation
```

Referring to abbreviations can then be done by using autolinks with the `abbr` scheme:

```
When writing a <abbr:CSV> file, make sure to escape double quotes with double quotes, and
<abbr:CAB> to explain other concepts.
```

renders as:

When writing a <abbr:CSV> file, make sure to escape double quotes with double quotes, and
<abbr:CAB> to explain other concepts.

Abbreviations expand to links in the abbreviations page, which is appended to the end of the book, with a separator.
To disable the chapter separator, set the `preprocessor.abbr2.separator` configuration key to `false`.

## Getting started

To get started, install the preprocessors:

```sh
cargo install mdbook-xref mdbook-abbr2
```

and add the required configuration to your `book.toml`:

```
[preprocessor.xref]

[preprocessor.abbr2]
before = ["xref"]
path = "abbreviations.csv"
```
